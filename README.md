# Social Network Analysis Project
Welcome to my Social Network Analysis project! In this project, I have taken on the role of a data scientist to analyze a social network dataset. 
The goal of this project is to construct a network from publicly available data sources, perform a range of network analyses, and address a specific research question using social network analysis tools.

### Project Overview
In this project, I have followed a structured pipeline that includes the following key steps:
1. Network Construction
2. Network Analysis
3. Open Question

This project reflects my commitment to exploring and understanding complex social networks, and I hope it provides valuable insights and methodologies for similar endeavors in the field of data science and social network analysis. 
Please feel free to explore the project and reach out with any questions or feedback!
